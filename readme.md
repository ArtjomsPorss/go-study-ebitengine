- animation
- hue / saturation / value - where spells are cast
  - in front - apply light and saturation over all character when spell in front of them
  - behind - at the edges of the character
- shader looks interesting - maybe can be used as a replacement of hue changes
- drag and drop - inventory
- isometric - the game itself - background, walls
- masking - draw a hole in the wall that is drawn in front of the character
